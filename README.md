Completing exercises from books and websites

With my recent heavy focus on more visual creating languages and frameworks, I had realized that I had let my more traditional programming abilities fall by the wayside; especially with the usage of JQuery that had made me too lazy for my tastes. I remade this repository from scratch so that I have a place to post random exercises that I hope I'll complete daily.

*Exercises is a catch-all folder containing coding challenges found on the web.

*YDK_series consists of a few coding challenges taken from the You Don't Know Javascript book series. There's not much code here to practice directly from, but it is a very good series that I'll continue to consume.

*The Eloquent directory are exercises completed in the code challenge sections of of the Eloquent Javascript book. This is much more like a pure programming book unlike Jon Dukett's. However, this also does not have very many coding sections.

*The JS book directory are exercises completed from the Jon Dukett's Javascript and JQuery book. This is the first book I had ever worked from, so at the time these were great for giving me much needed html and css practice primarily with a decent starting point to start writing webpages
