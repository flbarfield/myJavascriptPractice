# myJavascriptPractice

Completing exercises from books and websites

With my recent heavy focus on more visual creating languages and frameworks, I had realized that I had let my more traditional programming abilities fall by the wayside; especially with the usage of JQuery that had made me too lazy for my tastes. I remade this repository from scratch so that I have a place to post random excercises that I hope I'll complete daily.
